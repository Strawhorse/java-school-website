Need to do:
- Create backend SQL database to begin to take entries; maybe Tomcat or XAMPP
- Create database tables to accept login details and new accounts
- Begin to create functionality for query/comment section to store these queries
- Create login functionality ...


Hi Goran,
- Trying to build a website from scratch (no frontend frameworks) and I want to create all backend
- Functionality through Spring MVC
- I need Java to read HTML form data and, where necessary, read and write from a backend SQL database (which I have to create, but it'll be easy though), and do secure logins
- How much of this do you think you can input into?

*** You can fork the project to yourself and make your commits with notes and we can work on it that way, if you like?

I have a number of links above with great information on what to do; I have the basic front website pages built, so we only really need to work on a back end
